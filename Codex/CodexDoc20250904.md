Project: flengyel/timeseries-to-egt (main)

Goal: Codex-ready patches to (1) add docs/{pipeline,notebooks,api-quickref}.md and index, and (2) update README.md with $…$ math and CI/notebook guidance. Use unified diffs + Git Bash commands. Keep NumPy-2/ridge terminology. No network.

Status: Fast notebooks pass; CI job “Notebooks (fast)” on 3.12 is merged; data/ scaffold added.

Additional requirements:
- Documentation must be consistent with the demo notebooks (BIO_DEMO, CYBER_DEMO, FINANCE_DEMO, FIRM_DEMO, PROTEST_DEMO, SOCIO_DEMO, egt_timeseries_demo).
- Map each demo to pipeline stages (Signal isolation → Payoff induction → Strategy learning → Game estimation → ESS → Surrogates), naming functions and key shapes.
- Prefer generous documentation over terse: include inputs/outputs, brief rationale, small worked examples/snippets, and notes on determinism (seeds/TS2EG_CI), NumPy-2 idioms, and `ridge` usage.
- Preserve column-major (N×T) conventions and zero-sum projectors in formulas; keep $…$ / $$…$$ math.

Deliverables:
- Patch A: add docs/index.md, docs/pipeline.md (math), docs/notebooks.md (CI & tags), docs/api-quickref.md — aligned with demos.
- Patch B: README.md updates (math blocks, quickstart, CI, API, demo/pipeline mapping notes).
